Analyze the results of an A/B test and create a report of data-driven recommendation for GloBox. 

GloBox is an online marketplace that specializes in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world.

GloBox is primarily known amongst its customer base for boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. However, their food and drink offerings have grown tremendously in the last few months, and the company wants to bring awareness to this product category to increase revenue. Therefore, an A/B Test has been set up. 

**A/B Test Setup**

The Growth team decides to run an A/B test that highlights key products in the **food and drink category as a banner** at the top of the website. 

A - The control group does not see the banner

B - The test group sees the banner

**The setup of the A/B test is as follows:**

1. The experiment is only being run on the mobile website.
2. A user visits the GloBox main page and is randomly assigned to either the control or test group. This is the join date for the user.
3. The page loads the banner if the user is assigned to the test group, and does not load the banner if the user is assigned to the control group.
4. The user subsequently may or may not purchase products from the website. It could be on the same day they join the experiment, or days later. If they do make one or more purchases, this is considered a “conversion”
